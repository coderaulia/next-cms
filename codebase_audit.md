# React CMS — Codebase Audit

> **Build status:** TypeScript ✅ | ESLint ✅ | Vitest 53/53 ✅
>
> The project compiles and passes all tests. The issues below are logic, security, architecture, and resilience flaws that slip under those checks.

---

## 1. Security Flaws

### 1.1 ~~Admin Token Comparison Is Not Timing-Safe~~ ✅ Fixed

[isValidAdminToken](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/adminAuth.ts#L416-L423) now uses `crypto.createHash('sha256')` + `crypto.timingSafeEqual` on fixed-length digests of both values, eliminating the timing side-channel.

---

### 1.2 `assertAdminPermission` Calls `getAdminSession` Twice 🟡 High

[assertAdminPermission](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/adminAuth.ts#L591-L608) calls `assertAdminRequest` (which calls `getAdminSession` internally) and then **immediately calls `getAdminSession` again**:

```typescript
export async function assertAdminPermission(request, permission) {
  const unauthorized = await assertAdminRequest(request);  // ← calls getAdminSession
  if (unauthorized) return unauthorized;

  const session = await getAdminSession(request);           // ← calls getAdminSession AGAIN
  if (!session) { ... }
  ...
}
```

This doubles the DB round-trips on every permission-gated request. More critically, there's a **TOCTOU window** — the session could be invalidated between the two calls, causing inconsistent authorization state.

**Fix:** Have `assertAdminRequest` return the session, then pass it through.

---

### 1.3 `x-admin-token` Header Accepted in All Environments 🟡 High

[getAdminSession](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/adminAuth.ts#L498) reads the `x-admin-token` header only when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`, but the **fallback password auth** (`loginAdminUser`) compares plaintext passwords in fallback mode regardless of environment:

```typescript
// adminAuth.ts line 657
if (normalizedEmail !== fallbackUser.email || normalizedPassword !== fallbackPassword) {
```

In `loginAdminUser`'s fallback branch (L651-667), the plaintext `CMS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var is compared directly against user input with `!==` — no hashing, no timing-safe comparison. An attacker who triggers missing-schema errors can force this path even in production.

---

### 1.4 CSRF Cookie Is `httpOnly: false` by Design 🟠 Medium

[middleware.ts L46](file:///d:/web/react-cms/middleware.ts#L44-L51) sets the CSRF cookie with `httpOnly: false`. This is **intentional** (client JS must read it), but it means any XSS vulnerability allows CSRF token theft, completely bypassing CSRF protection.

The CSP allows `'unsafe-inline'` for scripts (L12), which significantly increases XSS attack surface. Combined, this weakens the CSRF defense substantially.

**Fix:** Remove `'unsafe-inline'` from `script-src` and use nonces instead.

---

### 1.5 Rate Limiter Keyed by `x-forwarded-for` — Easily Spoofable 🟠 Medium

[getClientIdentifier](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/services/requestSecurity.ts#L72-L76) trusts `x-forwarded-for` and `x-real-ip` headers directly:

```typescript
export function getClientIdentifier(request: Request) {
  const forwardedFor =
    request.headers.get('x-forwarded-for') || request.headers.get('x-real-ip') || '';
  const firstIp = forwardedFor.split(',')[0]?.trim();
  return firstIp || 'unknown';
}
```

Without a trusted proxy configuration, attackers can **bypass all rate limits** by rotating the `X-Forwarded-For` header value. This affects login lockouts, contact form rate limits, and admin API rate limits.

---

### 1.6 Media Upload Accepts Files Without MIME Type 🟠 Medium

[isAllowedFile](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/services/mediaStorage.ts#L60-L64) returns `true` when `file.type` is empty:

```typescript
function isAllowedFile(file: File) {
  const mimeType = (file.type || '').toLowerCase();
  if (!mimeType) return true; // ← BYPASSES TYPE CHECK
  return ALLOWED_MIME_PREFIXES.some((prefix) => mimeType.startsWith(prefix));
}
```

An attacker can upload arbitrary files (HTML, SVG with scripts, executables) by simply omitting the `Content-Type`.

**Fix:** Default to rejection when MIME type is missing, or infer type from the file extension.

---

## 2. Data Integrity & Race Conditions

### 2.1 ~~File Store Has No Concurrency Protection~~ ✅ Fixed

[fileStore.ts](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/fileStore.ts) now wraps every mutation function's entire read→modify→write cycle inside an in-process `withWriteLock` queue. Concurrent mutations are serialized so no read-modify-write race can occur. The internal `writeFileUnsafe` performs the raw I/O, while the public `writeContent` acquires the lock for external callers.

---

### 2.2 DB Rate Limiter Has a Race Condition 🟡 High

[assertRateLimitInDatabase](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/services/requestSecurity.ts#L120-L183) performs a SELECT then a separate UPDATE. Under concurrent requests, multiple requests can read the same `count` value before any of them increment it, allowing the limit to be exceeded:

```typescript
// Two requests see count=9 simultaneously
// Both increment to 10
// But 11 requests actually went through
```

**Fix:** Use an atomic `UPDATE ... SET count = count + 1 RETURNING` pattern or a database-level advisory lock.

---

### 2.3 ~~`bootstrapPromise` in `dbStore.ts` Can Swallow Errors Permanently~~ ✅ Fixed

[ensureDbBootstrap](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/dbStore.ts#L539-L655) now resets `bootstrapPromise` on both success and error, allowing retries after failures.

---

### 2.4 ~~`normalizeAdminRole` Defaults Unknown Roles to `super_admin`~~ ✅ Fixed

[normalizeAdminRole](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/adminPermissions.ts#L31-L37) now defaults to `'analyst'` instead of `'super_admin'`.

---

## 3. Functional Bugs

### 3.1 ~~Scheduled Content Is Never Actually Triggered~~ ✅ Fixed

All `unstable_cache` entries in [publicCache.ts](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/publicCache.ts) now have a `revalidate: 60` TTL (`SCHEDULED_CONTENT_TTL`). Content is automatically re-fetched and re-evaluated against `isStatusContentLive()` / `isPageLive()` at most once per minute, so scheduled publish/unpublish transitions take effect without manual intervention.

---

### 3.2 `validateBlogPost` Never Returns `null` for Missing Required Fields 🟠 Medium

[validateBlogPost](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/validators.ts#L366-L398) only checks `isObject(payload)` but never validates that critical fields like `id` or `title` are non-empty. The `asString()` helper silently converts missing values to `""`:

```typescript
export function validateBlogPost(payload: unknown): BlogPost | null {
  if (!isObject(payload)) return null;
  // No check for empty title, empty id, etc.
  return {
    id: asString(payload.id),  // Could be ""
    title: asString(payload.title),  // Could be ""
    ...
  };
}
```

Compare with `validatePortfolioProject` which correctly rejects empty titles (`if (!title) return null`). Blog posts don't get this treatment.

**Fix:** Add `const title = asString(payload.title).trim(); if (!title) return null;` like portfolio does.

---

### 3.3 Blog `queryBlogPosts` Uses Tags as "Categories" 🟠 Medium

[fileStore.ts L129-L136](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/fileStore.ts#L129-L136) and L145-L148 treat `tags` as categories for filtering:

```typescript
const categories = Array.from(
  new Set(
    content.blogPosts
      .flatMap((post) => post.tags)  // ← tags used as categories
      ...
  )
);
```

The CMS has a proper `Category` entity with its own CRUD, but the blog query system completely ignores it. The `categories` table exists in the schema but is never joined to blog post queries.

---

### 3.4 `postCategoriesTable` Has No Primary Key 🟠 Medium

[schema.ts L116-L126](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/db/schema.ts#L116-L126):

```typescript
export const postCategoriesTable = pgTable('post_categories', {
  postId: text('post_id').notNull(),
  categoryId: text('category_id').notNull(),
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at', { withTimezone: true, mode: 'string' }).notNull()
  // ← No primary key defined
});
```

Drizzle requires tables to have a primary key for proper ORM operations. The composite unique index exists, but this is not a PK. This can cause issues with Drizzle's `.onConflictDoUpdate()` and introspection.

---

### 3.5 Sitemap Generates Invalid URLs When `baseUrl` Is Empty 🟠 Medium

[sitemap.ts L29](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/app/sitemap.ts#L29):

```typescript
url: `${settings.baseUrl}${page.seo.slug ? `/${page.seo.slug}` : ''}`;
```

If `settings.baseUrl` is empty (which `asSafeBaseUrl` allows via `env.ts` fallback to `http://localhost:3000`), the sitemap will contain `http://localhost:3000/about` URLs in production. There's no guard preventing this from being served to search engines.

---

### 3.6 `editorSchedule.ts` Has a Timezone Bug 🟠 Medium

[toDatetimeLocalValue](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/editorSchedule.ts#L5-L18):

```typescript
export function toDatetimeLocalValue(value: string | null | undefined) {
  ...
  const offsetMinutes = date.getTimezoneOffset();
  const localDate = new Date(date.getTime() - offsetMinutes * 60_000);
  return localDate.toISOString().slice(0, 16);
}
```

This runs **server-side** where `getTimezoneOffset()` returns the server's timezone, not the admin user's timezone. An admin in Jakarta (UTC+7) editing scheduled times on a server in UTC will see times offset by 7 hours.

---

## 4. Architectural Issues

### 4.1 ~~`loadCmsStoreModules()` Is Called on Every Single Operation~~ ✅ Fixed

[loadCmsStoreModules](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/storeAdapter.ts#L28-L50) now caches the resolved modules in a module-level variable, avoiding repeated evaluations.

---

### 4.2 `storeShared.normalizeSettings` Uses Loose Object Spread 🟠 Medium

[normalizeSettings](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/storeShared.ts#L57-L132) does:

```typescript
const next: SiteSettings = {
  ...defaults,
  ...source,  // ← Spreads ALL unknown properties from untrusted input
  general: { ...defaults.general, ...general },
  ...
} as SiteSettings;
```

The `...source` spread copies **any arbitrary keys** from the input into the settings object. This could inject unexpected properties that downstream code might interpret incorrectly, or bloat the JSONB payload in the database.

---

### 4.3 Revision Deduplication Uses Full JSON Serialization 🟠 Medium

[captureContentRevision](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/contentRevisions.ts#L284-L288) compares revisions by serializing the entire payload:

```typescript
if (latest && payloadSignature(latest.payload) === payloadSignature(input.payload)) {
  return toSummary(latest);
}

function payloadSignature(payload: CmsRevisionPayload) {
  return JSON.stringify(payload); // Full-site payloads can be 100KB+
}
```

For `full_site` revisions, this serializes the **entire CMS content** twice (latest + incoming) on every save. This is O(n) in content size and generates significant GC pressure.

**Fix:** Use a hash (SHA-256) of the serialized content instead of comparing raw strings.

---

### 4.4 `defaultContent.ts` Is 64KB of Hardcoded Content 🟢 Low

[defaultContent.ts](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/defaultContent.ts) is 64KB and contains site-specific copy, branding, and content. This entire file is bundled into the server build and `structuredClone`'d on every file-mode read. It's also business logic masquerading as code — content changes require code deployments.

**Fix:** Move to a JSON fixture file loaded at runtime (partially done with `data/content.json`, but `defaultContent.ts` is still the canonical source of truth for bootstrapping).

---

## 5. Build & Tooling Issues

### 5.1 `next lint` Is Deprecated in Next.js 16 🟠 Medium

The lint command output shows:

```
`next lint` is deprecated and will be removed in Next.js 16.
For existing projects, migrate to the ESLint CLI:
npx @next/codemod@canary next-lint-to-eslint-cli .
```

With `"next": "^15.5.12"` in `package.json`, the next major version bump will break `npm run lint` and `npm run check`.

---

### 5.2 `@next/bundle-analyzer` Version Mismatch 🟢 Low

```json
"next": "^15.5.12",
"@next/bundle-analyzer": "^16.2.0"
```

The analyzer is on v16 while Next is on v15. These should be version-aligned to avoid potential webpack config incompatibilities.

---

### 5.3 `tsconfig.json` Includes Too Broadly 🟢 Low

```json
"include": ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", ...]
```

This includes `scripts/*.ts` (CLI tools with `tsx` shims, `process.exit()` calls, etc.) in the main TypeScript project. These scripts use different runtime assumptions than the Next.js app.

---

## 6. Dead Code & Tech Debt

### 6.1 Legacy Aliases on `SiteSettings` 🟠 Medium

[types.ts L396-L401](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/types.ts#L396-L401):

```typescript
export type SiteSettings = {
  ...
  // Legacy aliases retained for backward compatibility in existing renderers.
  siteName: string;
  baseUrl: string;
  organizationName: string;
  organizationLogo: string;
  defaultOgImage: string;
};
```

These duplicate `general.siteName`, `general.baseUrl`, and `seo.defaultOgImage`. They're synced in `normalizeSettings` and `validateSiteSettings`, creating **two sources of truth** that must stay in sync. Any code reading `settings.siteName` vs `settings.general.siteName` can get different values if normalization is bypassed.

---

### 6.2 Duplicate `isObject` / `extractErrorCode` / `nowIso` Definitions 🟢 Low

- `isObject` is defined in both [validators.ts L45](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/validators.ts#L45) and [storeShared.ts L13](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/storeShared.ts#L13)
- `extractErrorCode` is defined in both [adminAuth.ts L81](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/adminAuth.ts#L81) and [contentRevisions.ts L45](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/contentRevisions.ts#L45)
- `nowIso` is defined in both [storeShared.ts L11](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/storeShared.ts#L11) and [importExport.ts L55](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/importExport.ts#L55)

---

### 6.3 `branding.headerLogo` / `branding.footerLogo` Asset Resolution Missing 🟢 Low

[resolveSettingsAssetUrls](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/assetUrls.ts#L85-L95) resolves `organizationLogo` and `defaultOgImage`, but does **not** resolve `branding.headerLogo`, `branding.footerLogo`, or `branding.siteIcon`. If these are stored as relative `media/` paths, they won't get rewritten to the CDN base URL.

---

## 7. Performance Concerns

### 7.1 ~~File Store Reads Entire Content on Every Operation~~ ✅ Fixed

[fileStore.ts](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/fileStore.ts) now caches the parsed content in memory with a 5-second TTL, reducing disk I/O for frequent operations.

---

### 7.2 `revalidatePublicCmsCache` Revalidates Everything 🟠 Medium

[revalidatePublicCmsCache](file:///d:/web/react-cms/src/features/cms/publicCache.ts#L167-L181) invalidates **all** cache tags and **all** path patterns on every single admin mutation — even if only a blog post title changed. This forces re-rendering of the entire site on every save.

---

### 7.3 No Session Cleanup / Expiry Sweep 🟠 Medium

`admin_sessions`, `admin_login_lockouts`, `request_rate_limits`, `analytics_events`, and `page_404_log` tables grow unboundedly. There is no cleanup mechanism, scheduled purge, or TTL-based deletion for expired records.

---
